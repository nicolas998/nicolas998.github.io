I am currently an **Assistant Professor** at **Florida Tech** in the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering. Before joining FIT, I worked as an Assistant Researcher at the **Iowa Flood Center** developing and evaluating the Hillslope Link Model. I developed and implemented various modules to represent subsurface artificial drainage, snow processes, and the development of parameterization methodologies. Before working at the [**IFC**](https://iowafloodcenter.uiowa.edu/), I was the leader of the Hydrology group in the Environmental Alert System of the Aburr√° Valley [**SIATA**](https://siata.gov.co/siata_nuevo/). My current research is focused on flood forecasting, streamflow water temperature, model development, and evaluation metrics.
